# @polarish/cli

Polarish is an open-source SDK for building AI workflows where users bring their own AI subscriptions.

It has two packages that work in tandem:

- `@polarish/ai` — a TypeScript SDK to build AI workflows in your app.
- `@polarish/cli` — a local CLI bridge that helps users connect their AI subscriptions and run those workflows through local provider runtimes.

To deliver the full end-user experience, you typically use both packages together.

On first run, the CLI checks whether Codex and Claude Code are installed and authenticated. If not, it opens an interactive "Connect your subscriptions" flow to install and log in selected providers in one session.

The bridge HTTP server ships **inside** this package (`src/bridge/`). Installing `@polarish/cli` is enough; you do not install a separate `@polarish/bridge` package.

## Common commands

```bash
polarish status
polarish bridge run
polarish origins list
polarish origins add https://app.example.com
polarish origins remove https://app.example.com
```

## Installation

```bash
bun add -g @polarish/cli
```

```bash
bun add @polarish/ai
```

## Important first step

After installing the package, you must run:

```bash
polarish
```

This first run is required. It will guide you through installing and authenticating Codex and/or Claude Code.
